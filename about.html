                <p>I am a Computer Science Graduate with a First Class Degree in Computing and a Masterâ€™s Degree with Distinction in Computing in Education; completing both degrees whilst working full-time. I have always been interested in tech growing up and began programming at the age of 14. As a socially active and outgoing person, I began teaching which has helped me to develop strong interpersonal and presentational skills; both written and verbal. I have since then used these skills to teach the subject I love, however, I am still ravenous to enhance my own knowledge of programming and thus work freelance as a Software Developer. I have worked on various projects including developing the accounting system and website for small private companies such as Blackstone Motors LTD (www.blackstonemotors.co.uk). I have also worked as a Teaching Assistant at Universities and taught programming to other Computer Science Teachers at The Pixl Club LTD.</p>
